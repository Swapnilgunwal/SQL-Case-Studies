# SQL-Case-Studies

Welcome to my SQL Case Study where in I am using dataset from kaggle.com.

You can go to kaggle.com and work on the datasets provided by them. They have a huge resource of dataset to practice.

Login to kaggle.com

Export the required dataset(by default .excel format)

Open your Microsoft SQL Server.

Create a new database 'casestudies' using command 'create database casestudies'.
Run the SQL command 'use casestudies' to work in the specific database.
Import the .excel dataset downloaded from kaggle.com.
The .exce dataset will be imported in current database i.e., 'casestudies'.
Run 'Select * from table_name' to view your imported dataset.

Once all above steps are performed successfully, jump right into deriving insights from your data.
